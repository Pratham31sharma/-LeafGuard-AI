## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///leafguard_ai.db
MODEL_PATH=model.pth
FEATURES_PATH=features.pkl
LABELS_PATH=labels.pkl
```

### Model Training

To train your own model:

1. Organize your dataset in the `data/` directory
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```
3. The trained model will be saved as `model.pth`
